Tests are currently available for two different software token implementations,
NSS's softokn and softhsm (with some limitations).

The easiest way to configure things to run manual tests is to simply make check;
this will create two temporary directories with each token's configurations.

After make check has run, set up your environment with:
$ source tests/tmp.<softokn|softhsm>/testvars

Then you can run code like:
$ openssl pkey -in $ECPUBURI -pubin -pubout -out ecout.pub
